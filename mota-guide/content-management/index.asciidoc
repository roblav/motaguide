[[content-management]]
== Content Management

Our initial site audits and conversations with MOTA had identified a number of problems with the CMS itself. It was difficult for content editors to find content within the CMS, and editing content was cumbersome with no WYSIWYG editor. There were many duplications and redundant parts of the CMS that made it generally confusing to use.
There was no facility to schedule publishing in the future, no ability to optimise content for search engines and the site-wide search facility was lacking both in accuracy and speed. In this epic, we set out to rectify all of these issues.

*Areas to cover:*

* Show better content management. (Ease of search and filter options)

* Show Content Scheduling options

* Show site wide media management and better embedding of media in content

* Show Site wide search with Apache solr search for better search and filter options to end users.

=== Content Scheduling Options

By setting a ‘Published on’ date and a ‘Unpublished on’ date you can
control when to publish and unpublish content for viewing on the
website.

Scheduling options settings are available at the bottom of the content
edit form as one of the vertical tabs, as shown in the image below.

=== Managing media


==== Adding media

There are several ways that you can add media to the CMW, via WYSIWGY,
‘Content > Add files’, when you’re adding media when creating content.

There are a couple of options to add images and videos using the media
management tool.

==== Add media modal box
