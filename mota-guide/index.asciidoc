[[home-page]]
Home Page
---------

In the first epic, we set out to replace the homepage map experience
with a fresh design based on visuals supplied by the RAPP team. Given
that the old map experience was powered by Adobe Flash and therefore not
accessible to a wide range of users or search engines, one of the
primary goals was to develop the map using modern accessible
technologies.

*Areas to cover:*

* Updating individual island details
