== Pressroom and Media Contacts

Given that the new website was missing a pressroom section, we set out
to develop one in this epic. This is now available at
http://www.bahamas.com/pressroom[_http://www.bahamas.com/pressroom_].
Additionally, a new media contacts database was developed which is
acessible at
http://www.bahamas.com/media-contact/add[_http://www.bahamas.com/media-contact/add_].
