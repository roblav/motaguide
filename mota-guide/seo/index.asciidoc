= MOTA test

[[seo]]
== SEO

In this epic we set out to deliver much needed improvements in terms of
the SEO capabilities of the site. This included implementing best
practices such as a dynamically updating XML Sitemap, canonical URLs,
automatic redirects from internal to external URLs (no more /node/123
style URLs), as well as adding advanced tools to enable MOTA to control
keywords, meta descriptions, and other SEO tags on a page by page basis.

*Areas to cover:*

* Allow users to define the url redirects.
* Show checking seo properties for node while adding / editing
* Allow users to defined all seo properties while content definition.

URL Redirects and Meta tags settings are available at the bottom of the
content edit form as vertical tabs, as shown in the image below.

[[tokens]]
==== Tokens

Tokens, e.g. "[node:summary]", automatically insert the corresponding

meta data and possible search engine penalization; see the "Browse
available tokens" popup, available where tokens are used, for more
details.
